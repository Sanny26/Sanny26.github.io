## About Me
I’m Santhoshini, a graduate student majoring in Computer Vision at CMU. Over the next couple of years, I’m looking to dive deeper into improving the reasoning capabilities of end-to-end foundational models.

Previously, I’ve worked on a variety of research topics, including Seq2Seq models, multimodal representation learning, autolabeling, synthetic image generation, and domain adaptation.

### Featured Projects
- **[360 Panorama Generation](https://github.com/example/project2):** Image synthesis of real-world 360 panorama images using 3D object generation and placement.
- **[HWSearch](https://github.com/example/project1):** A zero-shot search engine for handwritten collections.
